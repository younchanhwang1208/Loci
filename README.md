Loci: Memory Palace is a XR product that is designed to bring the famous memory palace technique into life! Loci will help users enhance one of the most important cognitive abilities - memory. Using the idea that human brain is better at remembering images and locations than abstract information, users will be able to attach objects, images, or words that they want to memorize in specific locations around their house or familiar spaces. Users can interact with these objects through gestures, attaching detailed notes or multimedia content to each item for deeper cognitive connection. Such customizable, interactive environment not only aids in memory training but also in testing recall through systemic challenges where users locate and identify the purpose of each object.

Numerous studies indicate that engaging in 3D spatial context enhances memory encoding and retrieval, making Loci a perfect app for users to train and test their cognitive ability.
